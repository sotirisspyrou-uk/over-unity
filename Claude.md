### Implementation Approach
```javascript
// Example Claude API integration for feedback generation
const generateCandidateFeedback = async (candidateData, jobRequirements, rejectionReason) => {
  const response = await fetch("https://api.anthropic.com/v1/messages", {
    method: "POST",
    headers: {
      "Content-Type": "application/json",
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      model: "claude-sonnet-4-20250514",
      max_tokens: 1000,
      messages: [
        { 
          role: "user", 
          content: `Generate constructive feedback for a job candidate based on:
          
          Candidate Profile: ${JSON.stringify(candidateData)}
          Job Requirements: ${JSON.stringify(jobRequirements)}
          Rejection Reason: ${rejectionReason}
          
          Provide specific, actionable advice for improvement while maintaining empathy and professionalism.`
        }
      ]
    })
  });
  
  const data = await response.json();
  return data.content[0].text;
};
```

### Ethics & Compliance Framework
- Implement explainable AI principles
- Regular bias audits using statistical parity tests
- Compliance with NYC Local Law 144 and EU AI Act
- Data privacy by design (GDPR/CCPA compliant)

### Success Metrics
- Reduction in discriminatory screening patterns (target: <5% false negatives)
- Candidate satisfaction with feedback quality (target: >4.5/5)
- Time-to-hire improvement (target: 25% reduction)
- Employer diversity hiring improvements (target: 30% increase)

## Technical Considerations
- Use Claude for content generation, not decision-making
- Implement human-in-the-loop for final hiring decisions
- Store conversation history for continuous learning
- Rate limiting and cost optimization for API calls
